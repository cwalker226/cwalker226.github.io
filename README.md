# Personal Website

A personal website created by myself to show the work I created during my full stack developer bootcamp. This personal website was started during week 2 of the bootcamp. It is currently a work in progress.

## Built With

* HTML
* CSS
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/) - The web framework used


## Week 2 Requirements

* Functional, deployed application
* GitHub repository with README describing the project

### Directions

Here are some guidelines:

* Create the following pages: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.
* Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar
   * A responsive layout
   * Responsive images

* The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.

### Bonus

* Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site.

## Week 8 Requirements

* Updated portfolio featuring project 1 and two exemplary homework assignments. 
* Update GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring project 1 and two exemplary assignments. 
* Updated resume
* Updated LinkedIn profile


### Updated Portfolio

Your updated site should have the following content:

* Your name
* Links to your GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as your email address and phone number
* A link to a PDF of your resume
* A list of projects.


#### Design

Unfortunately, this is where it gets a little bit subjective. Your site should look "polished." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

* Mobile-first design
* Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.
* Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.


### Updated GitHub Profile 

* If you haven't yet, now is the time to update the following in your GitHub profile: 
    * Profile picture
    * Bio
    * Location
    * Email
    * Link to your portfolio
* Employers (and potential collaborators) _will_ look at your GitHub profile, so put your best face forward. 
* Pin some repos that you want to highlight
* Follow your classmates.


### Updated Resume 

Submit a clear, concise and compelling resume, tailored to the type of job youâ€™re looking for.


### Updated LinkedIn Profile 

Update your LinkedIn Profile with a strong bio statement, a professional photo, and links to your Github and portfolio.
